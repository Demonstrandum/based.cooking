<h1>Naan Bread</h1>

<p><img src="pix/naan-bread.webp" alt="Naan Bread" /></p>

<p>A curry serves best with naan that is unleavened bread. Traditionally made in ‘Tandoor or clay oven' but at home, we will be making it in the oven and/or on the stovetop. Naan is not eaten solely but acts as assortments with meat, veggies, or egg items.</p>
