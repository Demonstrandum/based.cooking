<h1>Hangover Eggs</h1>

<p>Whenever my friends back home would drink to excess, they&rsquo;d wake up wanting something tasty. I made them what I call &ldquo;Hangover Eggs&rdquo;. Whether
or not you&rsquo;re hungover, they&rsquo;re very delicious! I&rsquo;ve recently been making them to gain weight, though you can alter the recipe to whatever
suits your lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tony Chachere&rsquo;s</li>
<li>Green onions</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Loaf of French Bread</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Tabasco</li>
<li>Beer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring a cast iron pan to medium-high heat and add a second or two of olive oil when things start to warm up.</li>
<li>While the pan heats up, use your hands and tear off pieces of bread that are roughly the size of your hand.</li>
<li>Make sure you have one piece of bread per egg you want to make. I&rsquo;ve dabbled with the egg:bread ratios, and this seems to work.</li>
<li>Once the olive oil starts smelling a bit (or smoke comes off of it), crack in however many eggs you care to eat. Turn down the heat to medium.</li>
<li>Act fast! As the eggs start cooking, prepare a plate with two handfuls of chopped green onion and Tabasco.</li>
<li>After about four minutes (or when the tops of the eggs start to set), take out eggs and place on top of bed of onions &amp; Tabasco.</li>
<li>Turn heat back to medium-high and add a touch more olive oil. Place pieces of bread in pan.</li>
<li>Every so often, move the pieces of bread around to soak up the oil.</li>
<li>When the bread is about to turn a good shade of golden-brown, add a generous sprinkle of Tony Chachere&rsquo;s to the plated eggs (on top of them).</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and move the pan off the burner. Take out bread pieces and place on the same plate as the eggs.</li>
<li>Serve with glass of ice-cold beer.</li>
</ol>


<p>Ideally, you won&rsquo;t even need a fork! Simply use the bread to guide the eggs on top of each piece, break the yolk into the piece, and take a large
bite.</p>
