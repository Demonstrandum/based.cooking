<h1>Basic Sweet Potato Fries Recipe</h1>

<p><img src="pix/sweet-potato-fries.webp" alt="cooked sweet pototo fries in pan" /></p>

<p>A simple, tasty, and healthy carb based snack.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1-2 Sweet Pototoes (try different types)</li>
<li>Olive Oil</li>
<li>Cinnamon</li>
<li>Rosemary (optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Set oven heat to 425¬∞F (220¬∞C).</li>
<li>Grab a pan and put a layer of parchment paper (or aluminum foil) on it.</li>
<li>Chop the potato(es) on your cutting board with a sharp knife throwing them onto the pan.</li>
<li>Drizzle the fries with olive oil. Toss the fries with clean hands to coat the fries in olive oil. Now wash your hands with soap to remove excess olive oil.</li>
<li>Top generously with cinnamon and salt. Pepper and/or rosemary may be added for additional flavor if desired.</li>
<li>Put in preheated oven. Setting timer for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>At 20 minutes, flip the fries. Rubber tongs make it easy to grab and turn a lot.</li>
<li>Return to oven setting timer for another 10-20 minutes depending on quality of the oven and desired crispiness.</li>
<li>Enjoy. Maybe them put in a glass bowl.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>A fast method to cut the the sweet pototoes is first into fourths, slice the fourths, chops the sliced layers while stacked into fries.</li>
<li>If you want to experiment with a variety of fats, consider combining the olive oil with grass-fed butter and coconut oil. I believe the issue with coconut oil is it likes being cooked at lower temperatures or else the health quality of the oil will degrade.</li>
</ul>
