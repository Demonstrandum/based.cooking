<h1>Pho Soup</h1>

<p><img src="pix/pho-soup.webp" alt="Based Beef Pho" /></p>

<p>Vietnamese Pho Soup is a tea-like, beef based soup with a flavor profile that differentiates it from the traditional Western palette. This recipe is designed to be as easy to make as possible, while simultaneously being as based as possible.</p>

<li>üç≥ Cook time: 2 hours</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings:4</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Garlic (4-8 large cloves)</li>
<li>Spring Onions</li>
<li>Cardamom Seeds (10 or so)</li>
<li>Star Anise (4-5)</li>
<li>Ginger</li>
<li>Cinnamon Sticks (3-5 sticks)</li>
<li>Diced Beef (300g)</li>
<li>Beef Bones with marrow (3x)</li>
<li>Beef bouillon cubes (1-3)</li>
<li>Coriander (to taste)</li>
<li>1 Lime (to taste)</li>
<li>Fish/Oyster Sauce</li>
<li>Honey or Brown Sugar</li>
<li>Rice noodles</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Heat your oven and place the spices (garlic, cardamom seeds, cinnamon sticks, star anise and ginger) on a tray and bake them until browned or decently toasted.</li>
<li>Boil bones until you remove most of the scum, and transfer the spices from the oven into the pot. Life will be easier if you can place the spices in a tea strainer of sorts, otherwise, it&rsquo;s not the worst thing in the world fishing them out later on.</li>
<li>Add beef bouillon cubes, diced beef, fish/oyster sauce, and honey/sugar, then simmer for a couple hours with the lid on.</li>
<li>Cook the rice noodles (should only take a few minutes, just until the texture is al dente enough).</li>
<li>Once the broth is done cooking, fish out the spices that you added at step 2. It&rsquo;s worth doing this rather than accidentally chewing on a bit of star anise, trust me.</li>
<li>Cut up coriander and spring onions as garnish.</li>
<li>Add rice noodles to bowl, followed by the broth and its contents, followed by the garnish. This can be made and eaten within 1 hour if you want it quickly, but typically with broths the longer you simmer the tastier it&rsquo;ll be.</li>
</ol>
