<ul>
<li>⏲️ Prep: 30 mins</li>
<li>🍳 Cook time: 25 mins</li>
<li>🍽️ Servings: 45</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>18 ounces potatoes</li>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
<li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
<li>¼ cup butter</li>
<li>2 onions, finely diced</li>
<li>3 ½ cups finely chopped button mushrooms</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and mash; season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl while potatoes are cooking. Stir sour cream and baking soda together in a second bowl. Add water to flour mixture and blend in, followed by sour cream mixture. Knead into a smooth dough, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add to mashed potatoes.</li>
<li>Divide dough into 4 portions and roll each portion into a 1 &frac12;-inch thick rope. Cut ropes into small &frac12;-inch pieces. Press each dough piece into a small flat circle and place 1 teaspoon of potato filling in the center. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and seal edges.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add the vareniki in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a colander to drain.</li>
