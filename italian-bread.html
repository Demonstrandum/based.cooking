<h1>Italian Bread</h1>

<ul>
<li>⏲️ Prep time: 2.5 - 3.25 hr</li>
<li>🍳 Cook time: 25-30 min</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>600g or 5 cups bread flour (or all-purpose if not available)</li>
<li>1 packet (appr. 2 &frac14; tsp or 7g) active dry yeast</li>
<li>olive oil for greasing</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Follow directions on the packet to activate yeast in a bowl large enough for mixing the dough</li>
<li>Add enough water for a total of 400g or 1 &frac34; cups (i.e. add 400g minus however much water was used to activate the yeast)</li>
<li>Optionally add 12g or 2 tsp salt (Unsalted bread is normal in Central Italy, but it&rsquo;s an acquired taste)</li>
<li>Slowly mix in flour until it forms a dough that will be easy to work with and not overly sticky. Make sure there are no wet or dry pockets in the dough.</li>
<li>Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Knead the dough and let it rise covered for 1 hour in a warm place until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Split the dough in half and shape it into two loaves. Make sure the seams are at the bottom.</li>
<li>Place the loaves on a lightly greased baking sheet and let it rise covered for 1 hour in a warm place until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Make sure the oven is preheated to 200°C (400°F) before the resting period is over.</li>
<li>Score the loaves and place the baking sheet in the oven.</li>
<li>Bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
<li>Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
