<h1>Pasta (store bought)</h1>

<p>This is a simple outline of how to cook pasta.
TL;DR: you boil it.
Pasta is usually eaten with some kind of <a href="pasta-sauce.html">pasta sauce</a> or used in another dish.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>pasta</li>
<li>basil (optional)</li>
<li>butter (optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Fill a large pot about half or 3/4th full with water.</li>
<li>Salt the water profusely. The rule of thumb is that water for boiling pasta should taste as salty as the sea.</li>
<li>Bring water to a rolling boil.</li>
<li>Now add pasta.</li>
<li>Keep it boiling, but decrease heat as it tries to overflow.</li>
<li>Wait until pasta is at the preferred softness (see below), then strain it.</li>
<li>While the pasta is sitting in your strainer, you may add basil leaves or other herbs and aromatics. I also recommend taking a knob or so of room temperature butter and add it in and stirring it, melting it into the pasta.</li>
</ol>


<h3>How long should pasta be cooked?</h3>

<p>The often recommended way to cook most pasta is <em>al dente</em>, which often means &ldquo;slightly undercooked,&rdquo; or with a subtle firmness that makes it still substantial.
Cooking pasta more than that is no great crime,
but if you keep it in there for <em>too</em> long, it&rsquo;ll become mush.</p>
