<h1>Flammkuchen</h1>

<p>A recipe for Flammkuchen a very thin crust pizza-like dish - it originates from Elsass, a French region close to where I grew up.
I like the recipe because it takes 10 minutes to prepare and another 10 minutes to bake. It goes well with a green salad as a side.</p>

<ul>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings:2</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>400g Pizza dough (either bought or from <a href="pizza-dough.html">Pizza Dough</a>)</li>
<li>1 onion (I prefer the red ones for optical reasons)</li>
<li>150g bacon (you can replace it with mushrooms or other vegetables)</li>
<li>2 big spoons of sour creme or creme fraiche</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>we start by flattening the dough. Even if you buy thin crust that is already sold as &lsquo;super thin&rsquo; you have to make it even thinner. Make it so thin that you can fill 2 baking sheets with it (yes, you will make two large flammkuchen - since they are thin you need one per person) :)  I take two pieces of  parchment paper, put the dough in between and flatten it using a bottle (e.g. wine). It has to be as thin as possible (1-2 mm).</li>
<li>once the dough is flat, put it on your baking tray and preheat the oven at 450 to 500 Fahrenheit (230 to 260 Celsius)</li>
<li>distribute the sour cream evenly (it should be a very thin layer, just barely covering the dough</li>
<li>cut the onion and bacon into small pieces and distribute onion, bacon/vegetables (also in small pieces) evenly</li>
<li>put in the oven for 10 minutes and take it out when it is getting a bit dark. The thin parts will get a bit brown</li>
<li>put salt and pepper</li>
</ol>


<p>I usually take it down from the baking tray and let it cool down for 2-5 minutes before eating</p>
