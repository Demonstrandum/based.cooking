## Directions

1. Peel and cut the apples into {3-5 cm,1-2 inch} strips
2. Put the apples in a bowl and mix in the lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cornstarch and let it sit for 15 mins to release water
3. Transfer the filling mixture to a sauce pan and reduce the liquid over medium to low heat for around 15 mins, stirring regularly, then turn off the gas
4. While the filling is sitting / reducing, start the crust by putting the flour, salt, sugar, and pieces of butter in a food processor
5. Run the food processor until it resembles a coarse sand (5-10 seconds) then start dripping in the ice water until the mixture starts to chunk together
6. You'll know when it's done if you can pinch the dough with your hand and it sticks together
7. Preheat oven to {180,350}¬∞{C,F} then start making the pie crust
8.  Cut the dough in half and roll both halves out with a rolling pin until they are big enough to cover your pie pan (around 9 inch diameter)
9.  Put the bottom half dough into the pie pan and cut off the excess dough with a knife
10. Dump the sauce pan full of the filling into the pie pan and even it out
11. Cover the pie filling with the top dough and fold over and tuck in the excess crust
12. Use a fork or your fingers to pinch down the top crust to the bottom crust so you don't have air gaps
13. Optionally you can now brush on the egg wash to make the crust get a shiny golden brown color when it cooks
14. Cut a few slits in the top crust with a knife to give it a nice design and allow for air to release
15. Bake 45 minutes at {180,350}¬∞{C,F} or until the crust is brown to your liking and the apples are bubbling inside
